CSAPS -- Cubic Spline Approximation (Smoothing)

**csaps** is a package to approxime univariate, multivariate and n-dimensional gridded data
via cubic smoothing splines.

The package provides functionality for computing and evaluating splines.
It does not contain any spline analysis functions. Therefore, the package can be useful
in practical engineering tasks for data approximation and smoothing.

The package implements cubic smooting spline algorithm proposed by Carl de Boor in his book
"A Practical Guide to Splines" (`Springer <https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387953663>`_).

In other words, **csaps** is a Python modified port of MATLAB `CSAPS <https://www.mathworks.com/help/curvefit/csaps.html>`_ function
that is an implementation of Fortran routine SMOOTH from `PGS <http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~deboor/pgs/>`_
(originally written by Carl de Boor).
